cd - changes current directory

ls/ls -la - lists files included in the folder
git clone - makes a clone of the repository

git status - get commit status
git commit -m - saves the file/changes in clone repository
git add - stages file for committing
git push - adds to GitHub to the cloned repository 
git branch - shows you the branch you are on(for cloning your work so you dont have to put it directly on master branch)
git checkout -b feeature-branch - creates branch

Git tracks changes in the files by tracking the status of the branch. The three stages are Untracked: new file,not yet tracked, 
Modified: tracked file, modified since last comment, and Staged: files ready to commit. when you create a file it is untracked, 
once you make changes you can stage it by using "git add branch-name". To save or commit changes, use git commit -m "Comment describing changes"
To push on to your cloned repository on Git Hub use git push origin master
