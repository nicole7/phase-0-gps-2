1. Prior to this session, I struggeld with organizing the different folders and files and getting lost between them.
   I was also quite confused on the workflow of Git.
2. Clarification of certain commands
3. Mostly to clarify the difference and importance of certain commands and how to go back and start over if I get stuck somewhere
4. I'm still confused on merging and linking the screenshot
5. My pair didn't make it to our session. It was a bit awkward firguring out navigation/driving with the guide.
